My first tries with Javascript. A very simple pizza menu with basic calculations. It is a strong basic start to build a working website for a successful business.

     Tic Tac Toe
Contains a bit more complex Javascript code. I had lots of fun creating this simple game. 
Styled with CSS, it contains a simple 3by3 table. I added sound effects for a more realistic feeling.  
     
     Calculator
Very simple and functional calculator created with HTML, CSS & JS.

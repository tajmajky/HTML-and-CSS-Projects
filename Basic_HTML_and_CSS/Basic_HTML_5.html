<h1>  How To Make the Best French Onion Soup </h1>

<p>There are two essential components of a good French onion soup.

The first is the stock. Your soup will only be as good as the stock you are using. 
This soup traditionally is made with beef stock, though sometimes a good beef stock can be hard to come by and expensive to make.
If you use boxed stock, taste it first! If you don't like the taste, don't use it. 
(If you cook a lot of beef or beef roasts, save the scraps and freeze them to make a stock with later.)</p>

						<h3> <em> Christ in front of Pilate </em> by Mihaly Munkacsi (1881)</h3>
						<p>  Sedelmeyer wanted Munkácsy to paint large-scale pictures which could be exhibited on their own. <br>  They decided that a subject taken from the Bible would be most suitable. <br>
						In 1882 Munkácsy painted Christ in front of Pilate, followed by Golgotha in 1884. <br> The trilogy was completed with Ecce Homo in 1896. <br>
